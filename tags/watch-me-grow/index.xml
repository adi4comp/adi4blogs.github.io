&lt;p&gt;I thought about writing a technical blog, but the illusion of having too much work this week stopped me from using my time wisely. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often feel overwhelmed by our workload. When we finish a task, we think we deserve a break. Yet, even if the workload isn&amp;rsquo;t that heavy and we have plenty of time left, we still feel mentally exhausted. The brain works in funny ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a lot on your plate, your mind races with everything you want to do when you have free time. But for me, any free time I have (the kind I&amp;rsquo;m not tracking) passes by quickly. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it interesting how the semantics of time work? Time flies when you&amp;rsquo;re not thinking about it. But the moment you start to pay attention, it feels like it slows down. For example, I can hear my heartbeat when running, but my eyes are glued to the treadmill timer. I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting for those 20 minutes to pass, and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve run a marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, considering time as a dimension, general relativity tells us that time dilation occurs when moving at high speeds or being in a strong gravitational field. This is indeed a correct application of the theory. But is that all there is to it? Are there other factors influencing time dilation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In physics, there&amp;rsquo;s a concept called entropy, which helps us understand how energy spreads out and becomes less useful over time. This idea can be thought of as the &amp;ldquo;arrow of time&amp;rdquo;â€”as things move from order to disorder. You could say time helps determine how energy is used or wasted, even if time itself isn&amp;rsquo;t consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the philosophical idea of eternalism, which suggests that past, present, and future all exist at once. So, rather than time &amp;ldquo;running out,&amp;rdquo; every moment is just there, and our experience of moving through time is like traveling through a library of moments that are already written. When we feel like we&amp;rsquo;re wasting time, it might just be our perception of moving through those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, when we think about information, time can relate to how quickly we process and understand things. If we spend time on something unproductive, it might feel like we&amp;rsquo;re wasting itâ€”kind of like when our devices slow down, and it takes forever to get anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In quantum mechanics, thereâ€™s this idea called decoherence, where the tiny building blocks of reality interact with their surroundings, making things more predictable over time. Itâ€™s a bit like how a lively party turns into a quieter gathering as people leave; the chaos settles into order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explore these ideas, I wonder if any of this is true. Itâ€™s hard to grasp, right? If time exists as a dimension, what about the rate at which it changes? If all moments in time are out there, does that mean the energy at any moment never really moves on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty of it all makes me skeptical. Each theory presents a compelling story, but they also raise more questions than answers. If time is an illusion, what is the reality weâ€™re experiencing? And if our perception is merely a reflection of those timelines, can we ever truly waste it? But if we stop worrying about how much time we have or don&amp;rsquo;t have, we might find that thereâ€™s enough time for everything that truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Science of Writing Science</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-16/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I learned something that feels like a superpower. Itâ€™s not easy to learn, and I donâ€™t think there&amp;rsquo;s a course for it, but itâ€™s one of those things that, once you realize, changes how you think forever. So, buckle upâ€”this is the introduction to some very formal lessons coming up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent this week writing for my project, and every time I sent a draft to my advisor, I thought Iâ€™d nailed it. I mean, &lt;em&gt;masterpiece&lt;/em&gt; level nailed it. I had heard my advisor was strict about scientific communication, and Iâ€™d seen how clear his course presentations were. But when I got his feedback&amp;hellip; well, it was the same feedback everyone in the lab seemed to get. The moment I understood his point, I was both fascinated by his insight and completely embarrassed by my writing. After three rounds of edits and about a week of back-and-forth, I finally wrote&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;drumroll&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; two pages. Yes, two whole pages! But trust me, the mistakes and the process were invaluable lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reality-check-my-writing-was-not-good&#34;&gt;The Reality Check: My Writing Wasâ€¦ Not Good &lt;a href=&#34;#the-reality-check-my-writing-was-not-good&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I had this grand illusion that my thoughts were clear and my writing was top-notch. Yeah, no. That glass has shattered. What I thought was clarity was, in reality, a confusing mess. I realize now that this probably goes back to childhood habits. I was always a messy presenter of ideasâ€”especially in handwritten work. I hated it so much that, as a teenager, I rarely even did my own projects. Iâ€™d ask my mom or sister to make them for me! I thought those assignments were about creativity or art. But in reality, they were teaching us how to present ideas in an organized, visual way. There are people who write answers by highlighting the key points first. And then thereâ€™s me, crafting sentences so &amp;ldquo;elegant&amp;rdquo; that the point gets lost entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I can see why my university grades sometimes looked like crash test dummies. It wasnâ€™t just my handwriting; my ideas were stuck in my brain and didnâ€™t make it onto the paper. Twice, I even had professors on the verge of ripping up my answer sheets! At the time, I thought it was just about presentation or handwriting, but really, the problem was that I hadnâ€™t written down what was actually in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, finally realizing I need to fix this. Better late than never, right? From now on, Iâ€™m making an effort to get better at scientific writing. Iâ€™m going to use my blog to convey ideas, and Iâ€™ll start sending drafts to people for feedback. Iâ€™ve learned that the core of scientific writing isnâ€™t about showing off vocabulary (sorry, past me), but about getting ideas across clearly and directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-it-simple-and-visual&#34;&gt;Keep It Simple (And Visual!) &lt;a href=&#34;#keep-it-simple-and-visual&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first rule of &lt;del&gt;fight&lt;/del&gt; write club? Keep sentences short. (If this blog seems ironic to you, well, just know Iâ€™m still learning!) Long sentences lose the reader, and that makes total sense. Another key? Write in order. The best texts allow the reader to build context by reading each line in sequence, without jumping all over the place. And, surprise surprise, the simpler the writing, the better. If someone with no background can understand your work, you&amp;rsquo;ve won. Unlike literary devices, where complexity might add depth, in science, it adds confusion. The best ideas should pop up right in the beginning, so the reader doesnâ€™t get lost in unnecessary details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing Iâ€™ve learned is about maintaining context sizeâ€”each word should be an abstraction of either a well-known concept or something from your own contribution. The fewer abstractions (verbs, nouns) you use to explain your idea, the clearer it becomes. Think of it like this: itâ€™s all about how many key words you need to describe your idea accurately. And diagrams? Theyâ€™re golden. A picture really does speak a thousand wordsâ€”if itâ€™s simple enough! Diagrams should communicate ideas as cleanly and minimally as possible. If you can follow all of this, wrap things up with a strong claim to leave an impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hereâ€™s the cool part: I now appreciate all the things I used to overlook. Diagrams in scientific texts, animations in videos, slides in presentationsâ€”each word spoken by a presenter has a purpose. Itâ€™s so difficult to encapsulate a whole idea in just a few minutes of talking or writing. And itâ€™s not just short presentationsâ€”long ones are hard too, because people are more likely to zone out. The challenge is to keep their attention and communicate the core idea early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since joining this program, Iâ€™ve seen some excellent presentations. What stood out to me was how much time these presenters spent setting up the background. Only about 25% of the time was devoted to their actual contribution. This is exactly opposite of what our bachelor thesis presentations at KGP trained us for: spend most of the time on the results! I think the focus on results was about proving our sincerity, not the novelty of our ideas (especially since we only had 10 minutes to present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, this blog may not fully follow the lessons Iâ€™ve learned this week, but itâ€™s a start. Iâ€™ll be writing more technical blogs from here on out, putting these new skills into practice. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Navigating the Grey</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-13/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 21:33:19 +0800</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was reflecting on kindnessâ€”why itâ€™s important to do something kind every day. Kindness is a virtue, but expecting it from others can be a slippery slope. What we often forget is that the essence of kindness lies in not expecting anything in return: no redemption, no reward, just the simple act of giving because you feel you&amp;rsquo;ve received more than your share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble arises when weâ€™re treated poorly. We start to question whether being kind is even worth it. The truth is, you canâ€™t expect everyone to be kind. Itâ€™s a choice we each make, and we have to live with that choice. As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Either you die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.&amp;rdquo; The root cause of this disillusionment is often expectations. We hold people to unspoken standardsâ€”hoping theyâ€™ll behave in ways we deem â€˜nice.â€™ But silent expectations are dangerous. If you want something, sometimes you need to say it out loud; other times, you simply need to accept people as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can do something kind without expecting anything in return, then do it. Donâ€™t keep score. And if youâ€™re looking for a reward, be upfront about it. Otherwise, maybe the action isnâ€™t worth taking. This brings me to a personal struggle: ethics. Philosophers often say ethics are boundaries created by the weak to make themselves feel better. And when I think about whether Iâ€™m a good person or not, I come to a humbling realizationâ€”I have some of the wildest thoughts. Thoughts filled with petty rage, grudges, and other emotions Iâ€™m not proud of. But the key is, I donâ€™t act on them. I do my best to control those urges and not let them dictate my decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve come to see that itâ€™s not all black and white. Life is more of a grey area. And that grey is often fueled by the volatility of my mind. Most of the time, I manage to keep things in check, though the frequency of losing control is higher than Iâ€™d like to admit. When that happens, I take a step back and reflect, and usually, I calm downâ€”at least for a while. This cycle reminds me of when I struggled with stress-eating a year ago. I could control it for some time, but then, over the smallest trigger, Iâ€™d spiral out of control. Once I thought Iâ€™d crossed the line, I felt like I was already in the dark, so why not fully commit? But the truth is, I wasnâ€™t in the darkâ€”I was in the grey. Thereâ€™s always a way back, always progress to be made. There are no losses, only lessons. And just like my fat-loss journey, Iâ€™d falter, then bounce back even stronger. Eventually, I got so far past the line that I could stay above it. (Though, to be honest, the journey is still ongoing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other areas of my life I know I can improve. Iâ€™ve always struggled to find a balance between whatâ€™s good for my mind and whatâ€™s good for my personal growth. Iâ€™ve swung to the extreme ends of both, and Iâ€™m sure this is something many people can relate to in some part of their lives. Itâ€™s easy to feel like you canâ€™t come back once youâ€™ve gone too far, but the reality is that most of our actions lie in the grey zone. And in most cases, thereâ€™s always a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the best way out is sleep. Sleeping solves most of my problems. When Iâ€™m weighed down by my thoughts or my conscience, a good nightâ€™s sleep brings me clarity. Itâ€™s not meditation, but itâ€™s effective for me. And I think thatâ€™s an important lesson: if youâ€™re having a bad day, donâ€™t give up so soon. Itâ€™s easy to forget that most good ideas donâ€™t come from immediate breakthroughs. They emerge after hours of trial and error, often following silly mistakes. I used to feel the need to justify my process to othersâ€”explaining that I wasnâ€™t just slacking offâ€”but what Iâ€™ve learned from my time at NUS is that the final ideas arenâ€™t the time-consuming part. Itâ€™s the wrong ideas that take time. Itâ€™s figuring out why they donâ€™t work that demands so much energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of fragile minds, how often do we start down one path, only to realize halfway through that weâ€™ve been wrong the entire time? For me, this happens frequently. Iâ€™ll be convinced Iâ€™m on the right track, only to suddenly realize Iâ€™ve been lost all along. I think the root cause is my tendency to imagine how the outcome will look, getting so wrapped up in the destination that I lose sight of the actual journey. I forget to evaluate whether Iâ€™m truly heading in the right direction, and by the time I recognize the detour, it feels like Iâ€™m too far gone. But even then, thereâ€™s a lesson: itâ€™s not about how far off track youâ€™ve gone, but about recognizing it and adjusting course. Itâ€™s all part of the grey areaâ€”thereâ€™s always a way to correct yourself if youâ€™re willing to stop, rethink, and move forward with fresh insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons in Patience, Focus, and Output</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-12/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 22:34:20 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has a strange way of humbling you, especially when you donâ€™t realize youâ€™re wrong. If youâ€™re lucky enough, youâ€™ll recognize whatâ€™s happening before itâ€™s too late. Just last year, during an internship project, I found myself adapting to the problem statement much faster than my teammates. This gave me a sense of superiorityâ€”I used to get frustrated when they couldnâ€™t keep up and contribute equally. I convinced myself that they werenâ€™t putting in as much effort, which made it easy to look down on them for not pulling their weight.
At that time, I grew resistant to group projects where one person seems to do all the work while others bask in the success. However, life has a way of bringing you full circle. In my current project, Iâ€™m working on an exciting problem with a colleague who is much smarter, more organized, and meticulous than I am. This has been a humbling experience. While I sometimes feel disappointed when things donâ€™t go my way or when I canâ€™t lead from the front like Iâ€™m accustomed to, I recently realized how slow of a learner I am compared to him.
What struck me yesterday was how quickly he picked up concepts in a field thatâ€™s completely new to both of us, while I spent a whole week getting nowhere. In one hour of structured thinking, he helped me generalize a solution that took me days of effort to even brute-force. It gave me a strange sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu, reminding me of my impatience during previous internships when I was in the stronger position.
I now realize that I had wrongly assumed my former colleagues werenâ€™t trying as hard as I was. I didnâ€™t take their learning speed into account. My colleague today is far more patient with me than I ever was with my teammates. Iâ€™m grateful for this realization, and all I can say is looking forward if I am in a similar position again, I will be much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-minds-maze-keeping-track-of-the-core-idea&#34;&gt;The Mindâ€™s Maze: Keeping Track of the Core Idea &lt;a href=&#34;#the-minds-maze-keeping-track-of-the-core-idea&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important realization Iâ€™ve had is how easily you can get lost in your thoughts, and how important it is to stay grounded. Itâ€™s all too common to lose track of the core idea when youâ€™re deeply immersed in thought. This is why itâ€™s crucial to note down important pointsâ€”especially when you take a break.
When you write down what youâ€™ve done and evaluate how much it contributes to the solution, it helps you recognize whether youâ€™ve wandered off course. Successful people often say itâ€™s easy to control your mind, but for me, trying to control a thought often leads to distractions. The mind works recursively, pulling you off-topic the moment you try to focus. Writing things down keeps you tethered so that even if you get lost, you can always return to your original line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;output-over-input-finding-a-balance&#34;&gt;Output Over Input: Finding a Balance &lt;a href=&#34;#output-over-input-finding-a-balance&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone told me, &amp;ldquo;Nobody cares about the input; everyone wants the output.&amp;rdquo; As intimidating as that sounds, itâ€™s true. You can use this mindset to stay productive by constantly thinking about how your actions contribute to the final result. But itâ€™s not always the best approach. Sometimes, when you can&amp;rsquo;t see a fully formed solution, you waste time trying to force it.
Sometimes, when a solution feels trivial or intuitive, it wasnâ€™t truly intuitiveâ€”it only seems that way because youâ€™ve built up the necessary knowledge base through hard work and trial and error. The wrong paths you take still add to your understanding.
So, when is the &amp;ldquo;output over input&amp;rdquo; mindset useful? It helps when you start feeling overwhelmed by the effort required to reach a solution. From the outside, the final result might look simple and intuitive, but you know the depth of effort behind it. Keeping your focus on the output can help you push through without letting the difficulty of the process slow you down.
A perfect example is Albert Einstein. When he developed the theory of general relativity, it might seem obvious to us today, but it wasnâ€™t intuitive back then. He spent nearly a decade wrestling with complex mathematics, rethinking assumptions, and even seeking help from others. The journey was long, but Einstein didnâ€™t get caught up in the difficulty. He remained focused on the result. Even after achieving success in 1919, Einstein didnâ€™t rest. He continued pushing boundaries, tackling new challenges like quantum mechanics and the search for a unified field theory.
Einsteinâ€™s ability to focus on the output, rather than getting bogged down by the input, serves as a powerful reminder. Sometimes, we get overwhelmed by the effort, but by keeping our eyes on the outcome, we can keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

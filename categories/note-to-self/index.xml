      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The title is a punchline by comedian Jimmy Carr, which inspired me to write this blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;intro.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
This (left) was the exact moment I realized ‚Äî I need to lose weight. I started, and at every step, I thought, &amp;ldquo;I should write about this and wrap it up.&amp;rdquo; But honestly, it felt like watching water drain from a pot ‚Äî slow, drop by drop. Luckily, each time, I bested myself and improved. No notes. Just stuck with what worked and ditched what didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I&amp;rsquo;ve hit a plateau (like ML research). So, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take notes. Not just to show off (though I&amp;rsquo;ll keep throwing shapes while I still can) but for me. This page has become my stash of raw thoughts ‚Äî a place I revisit to relearn lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the sweets piling up at home, I&amp;rsquo;m going to need those lessons sooner rather than later. So, here we go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-1-false-start-12th-august-2023---12th-september-2023&#34;&gt;Part 1: False Start (12th August, 2023 - 12th September, 2023) &lt;a href=&#34;#part-1-false-start-12th-august-2023---12th-september-2023&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first attempt at losing weight. Far from it. I followed the same &amp;ldquo;genius&amp;rdquo; plan I always do ‚Äî oats in the morning, water-soaked sprouts at night. If I had a nickel for every time I started this routine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even threw in some exercise at the college hall gym, feeling like a model of discipline. Tracked my weight and, according to my calculations, I&amp;rsquo;d dropped 5 kg. But here&amp;rsquo;s the catch. My &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo; sprout dinner? Topped with Aloo Bhujia ‚Äî a delicious, crispy Indian snack packing a casual 600 calories per 100g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on September 12th, 2023. I decided to check my progress on the official gym scale at the central gymnasium. Drumroll&amp;hellip; 134.2 kg. I had to double-take. &amp;ldquo;Wait, what? No, no, no. This isn&amp;rsquo;t right.&amp;rdquo; See, at my local hall gym, it said 125-126 kg. Turns out that scale maxed out at 125 kg. So every time I stepped on it, the needle just swung around like it was counting down for a rocket launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;scale.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in my room, I felt like a failed experiment. I told a friend, &amp;ldquo;This is pointless, man. I&amp;rsquo;m done.&amp;rdquo; Then, before crashing for the night, I scrolled through some old photos from the Banff trip. This reminder was enough. I woke up, went straight to the gym, snapped a photo, and made some ammends -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gym.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strict diets are hard to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count calories and eat below resting body needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dont eat carbs and fats together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A slip-up isn&amp;rsquo;t a reset ‚Äî just a delay. (This is where I went wrong before, most of the times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-2-the-awakening-13th-september2023---3rd-january2024&#34;&gt;Part 2: The Awakening (13th September,2023 - 3rd January,2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#part-2-the-awakening-13th-september2023---3rd-january2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most important one. A friend once told me, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúOnce you start losing weight, you&amp;rsquo;ll keep going as soon as you see the changes.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; True story&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what I ate ‚Äî probably because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t consistent. I just tracked calories and aimed for a calorie deficit. This semester was packed with career-related applications, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;ldquo;busy schedule&amp;rdquo; excuse to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key moment was cutting back on sweets. I tried to keep sugar under 20g a day (Google says 36g is &lt;em&gt;‚Äúfine‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;). If a social gathering wrecked my diet, I&amp;rsquo;d balance it out by eating light for a few days. Simple math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the big bren moment of this phase ‚Äî water weight. Turns out, most of the weight you &amp;ldquo;gain&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; is just water. Shocking, right? Water is &lt;em&gt;biochemically essential&lt;/em&gt;, but, as Robin from HIMYM said, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you have chemistry, then only one thing matters ‚Äî TIMING.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; And that applies to water too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learned (part observation, part Google search):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No water during or right after meals&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî especially carb-heavy ones. Apparently, every gram of unburned carbs holds onto 3g of water and eventually turns into fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a gap between meals and water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for ingredients that make you thirsty&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî like baking soda (a buffet&amp;rsquo;s USP for filling you up while keeping costs low).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink plenty of water&lt;/strong&gt; - for digestion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &amp;ldquo;engineering hacks&amp;rdquo; helped me drop from 135+ kg to around 117-118 kg by year&amp;rsquo;s end. No fancy techniques, just sweat. (And by &amp;ldquo;sweat,&amp;rdquo; I mean &lt;em&gt;literally anything in gym&lt;/em&gt; that made me sweat ‚Äî not &amp;ldquo;hard work&amp;rdquo; in the motivational quote sense.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proud of the progress, I even wrote about it in my year-end blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yearendpng&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;yearend.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#yearendpng&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-3-the-climb-4th-january-2024---30th-april-2024&#34;&gt;Part 3: The Climb (4th January, 2024 - 30th April, 2024) &lt;a href=&#34;#part-3-the-climb-4th-january-2024---30th-april-2024&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the year, I got back to campus with fresh hopes, New Year‚Äôs resolutions, and big plans for my career and health. This time, I wanted to speed up my weight loss, so I tried intermittent fasting. Was it a good idea? Still not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to eat fewer than 1000 calories a day, even though my body needed 2100 just to exist. To &amp;ldquo;make it easier,&amp;rdquo; I‚Äôd count up to 800 calories and leave 200 as an error margin. Mentally and physically, it was draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My go-to diet during this time was poha from the hall canteen, turmeric milk at night (because &amp;ldquo;good for blood and fat loss&amp;rdquo; sounded convincing), and a daily orange juice. Gym sessions were random ‚Äî the goal was just to sweat, not follow a plan. Empty-stomach workouts? Bad idea. But I did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;midfeb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Harsh Intermitent fasting phase&#34;&gt;
Still, it worked. In about 40 days, I dropped below 110 kg. Feeling confident, I upped my calorie intake from 1000 to 1200, which let me have a proper meal once a day plus turmeric milk or orange juice. The fasting continued, but with less suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I hit double digits ‚Äî under 100 kg for the first time in 5+ years. People noticed. Compliments started rolling in. Naturally, I updated my display picture. It felt big. Not just because of the weight loss, but because I finally felt like I had some control ‚Äî not just over my weight, but over discipline itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Worked for Me (Observations, Not Advice):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calorie deficit works&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Eat less than you burn, plain and simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut deep-fried food&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Obvious but effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt eat sugar on an empty stomach&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî This includes fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt mix high-carbs and high-fats in one meal&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Kept them separate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roti is solid&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Wheat bread (roti) kept me full and sane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water timing matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber helps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast after bad meals&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî If I overate, I‚Äôd fast for a few hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track weight constantly&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî I weighed myself after every meal, workout, and bathroom trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple diet works&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Complicated diets don‚Äôt last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent fasting works (not recommended)&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî In desperate times, one of the best solutions if you are determined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random gym workouts work for weight loss (not fat loss)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this phase, I was down to approximately 97 kg. But I think I became nutritionally weak. I lost a lot of weight, but also significant muscle mass. The workouts I did had no clear purpose other than to make me feel good and burn some calories. Even though my body fat percentage dropped from 37% to 28%, the subcutaneous fat remained almost the same. In layman‚Äôs terms, I had loose skin. A bittersweet result ‚Äî but progress nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lastdaypng&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lastday.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#lastdaypng&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-4-error-correction-1st-may-2024---30th-july&#34;&gt;Part 4: Error Correction (1st May, 2024 - 30th July) &lt;a href=&#34;#part-4-error-correction-1st-may-2024---30th-july&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb was impressive, but there were obvious issues. First, I was losing muscle mass. Second, body fat (though inaccurate) was still high. Third, my workouts had no structure ‚Äî I was just loosing water weight. So, after returning home from campus (with a heavy heart and a lighter frame), I decided to research how the body actually works. The goal shifted from &amp;ldquo;lose weight&amp;rdquo; to &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;lose fat&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized &lt;strong&gt;intermittent fasting isn‚Äôt that great&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs fine for gut cleaning, but not great for metabolism or brain function (turns out, your brain needs carbs). I also learned that gym workouts break &lt;strong&gt;both muscle and fat&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you don‚Äôt have enough protein, your body will &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; itself by eating its own muscles.  Being vegetarian didn‚Äôt help. Protein-rich vegetarian food is hard to find unless you want to survive on paneer and chickpeas. So, I increased my calorie intake to 1400-1500 to fit in more protein. If you‚Äôre a non-vegetarian, this step is way easier. &lt;strong&gt;I also started whey protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Ignored the uncle WhatsApp warnings and gave it a try. Not all brands worked for me ‚Äî some caused bloating. After a few experiments, I found one that didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next, I fixed my workouts.&lt;/strong&gt; I stopped doing random HIIT-style workouts and switched to structured weight training. The &amp;ldquo;use your body weight&amp;rdquo; advice from uncles sounds good until you realize &lt;strong&gt;I weighed over 100 kg&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî that‚Äôs like bench-pressing a small fridge. Lifting weights was smarter. Plus, cardio felt like torture, and I didn‚Äôt want to quit, so I stuck with weights. I still get anxious before cardio days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With summer in full swing, I had a routine. My mom catered to my diet requests (felt like royalty). I upped my protein intake to &lt;strong&gt;150g/day&lt;/strong&gt; (natural sources + whey). In hindsight, it might‚Äôve been too much, but it worked. By the end of summer, I was down to &lt;strong&gt;91 kg&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;24% body fat&lt;/strong&gt; (possibly inaccurate, but we take those wins).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways (Not Advice, Just Observations):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein is essential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workouts break muscle, protein and rest fix it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight training works for fat loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not all protein powders suit me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This diet isn‚Äôt sustainable long-term&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî As Nikki Glaser said, ‚ÄúIf you follow Tom Brady‚Äôs diet, you can lose so much&amp;hellip; family.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;endphase.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-present&#34;&gt;The Present &lt;a href=&#34;#the-present&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After moving to Singapore for my PhD, I had to manage two things ‚Äî my diet and my career. I have this habit of making resolutions whenever a new phase of life begins. One of them was to keep the workout streak alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I stuck to it. I follow a 5-day workout schedule: 4 days of weight training and 1 day of cardio. Some weeks, I also play squash with my labmates (once a week). It‚Äôs like cardio, but more fun because you‚Äôre hitting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore made it easier. The city is convenient, and I managed to settle into a stable diet without burning too much money or effort. For lunch, I stick to saut√©ed vegetables ‚Äî no bread, no rice. Just veggies. I wash that down with fruit juice and iced coffee (Americano). Evenings are for milk with cereals or curd (yogurt) with soaked rice flakes. I keep snacks on my desk but have trained myself not to constantly munch on them. This is personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, I consume around 1400-1500 calories a day with about 100g of protein (a mix of natural sources and supplements). I feel good. My knees are fine (which is big for me since I once had arthritis), and my physical health seems solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I‚Äôm 6&#39;1&amp;quot; and weigh 83-84 kg with a body fat percentage of around 19% (disclaimer: could be inaccurate). Technically, I‚Äôm healthy. But I‚Äôd like to cut down a bit more body fat while keeping my weight steady ‚Äî aiming for that lean look everyone pretends not to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.:&lt;/strong&gt; I don‚Äôt have a good recent photo to show off, but if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably seen me recently anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proposed-algorithm&#34;&gt;Proposed Algorithm &lt;a href=&#34;#proposed-algorithm&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had to turn my takeaways into an algorithm for fat loss (assuming your starting point is similar or better than mine), here‚Äôs how it would go. This is not concrete tip‚Äî just my advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change eating habits fast, but not brutally&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Go fast, but don‚Äôt self-destruct. If it‚Äôs too slow, you‚Äôll quit out of boredom. Examples: Cut sugar, don‚Äôt quit it. Ditch deep-fried snacks, but don‚Äôt exile all snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight training &amp;gt; Running&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî It‚Äôs scientifically backed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; psychologically easier. If you start with running, you‚Äôll hate it, and you‚Äôll quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with calorie deficit, forget macros (for now)&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Early on, calorie deficit is king. Don‚Äôt stress over protein, carbs, and fats at the start. Just burn more than you eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you‚Äôre ‚Äúin,‚Äù balance macros&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî When you‚Äôre in the flow, it&amp;rsquo;s time to level up. Increase protein intake, cycle carbs and fats, and start fine-tuning your diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water intake ‚â† water discharge&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Food is a few hundred grams, but water after meal gets retained and hence the sudden weight gain after a bad meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water timing matters&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Don‚Äôt drink water right after a (especially if carb-heavy) meal. Keep a gap. But also don‚Äôt forget that water + fiber = good digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you mess up (cheat meal), fast for a bit&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Had a cheat meal? No problem. Do a short fast (a few hours) to clean your gut, and control your intake over the next few days. The goal is to drop the water weight that tags along with bad food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abuse the weight scale&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî Weigh yourself often ‚Äî after meals, workouts, or bathroom trips. The scale isn‚Äôt your enemy; it‚Äôs your debugger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don‚Äôt chase perfection ‚Äî aim for 60% consistency&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî You don‚Äôt have to be perfect every day or even every week. Apply the &amp;ldquo;60% rule&amp;rdquo; ‚Äî if you‚Äôre on track most of the time, you‚Äôre winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing off,&lt;br&gt;

      <title>A long list of TIL</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-19/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 23:30:29 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Last week, I broke my streak due to a mismanaged schedule. However, I‚Äôll try to write two posts this weekend. But first, let‚Äôs start with the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôve mentioned in previous blogs, I was working on a project in a completely new field. I was surrounded by people much smarter than me, and it was humbling. However, the last month threw me off track from my goal of having an orderly life‚Äîa perfect routine of morning workouts, productive days, and evening reading. To be fair, I managed 1 and 2, but 3 just didn‚Äôt happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I faced mental fatigue after working during the day‚Äîmaybe because of the illusion that I had done something meaningful‚Äîwhich left me unable to muster the energy to read at night. The past month required some mechanical contributions from my end, but somehow, we managed to catch up to the planned timeline and wrap it up on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the topic of author contributions came up. The professor thought I contributed equally to my senior. But honestly, as much as I tried in the last three months, I think I couldn‚Äôt match his level. Mechanically, I delivered. Intellectually, I was catching up. I confronted my feelings by crediting my senior and acknowledging that he deserved higher recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I felt bad‚Äîlike I was discrediting myself. This means my PhD research plan is still where it started. I kind of saw this coming, though. I got too attached to the project, so when we submitted it, I was sad it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking back, I think the attachment had a purpose. It taught me something valuable in the very first semester of my PhD. The project isn‚Äôt over yet, but if I don‚Äôt note down the lessons now, they‚Äôll fade into the ether. So here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-note-to-future-aditya-hopefully-reading-this-as-phd-candidate&#34;&gt;A Note to Future Aditya (Hopefully reading this as PhD candidate) &lt;a href=&#34;#a-note-to-future-aditya-hopefully-reading-this-as-phd-candidate&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, Aditya. If you‚Äôre reading this, chances are life feels like a mess again, and you‚Äôre desperately looking for something to bring back order. Well, here‚Äôs the lesson you learned in your first semester of PhD‚Äîstraight from past you to future you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-chaos-needs-order-not-vibes&#34;&gt;1. Chaos needs order, not vibes. &lt;a href=&#34;#1-chaos-needs-order-not-vibes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life‚Äôs messy, but problems love structure. Always start by writing things down. Formalize the problem. Yes, it feels tedious. No, it‚Äôs not optional. If you don‚Äôt, the problem will disappear into the Bermuda Triangle of your brain, taking the solution with it. Once the problem is clear, list out related problems and existing solutions. Then‚Äîthis part is crucial‚Äîorganize them by priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always keep in mind that everything eventually has to go in an academic manuscript. Keep track of each section, listing key points for that section under the heading every now and then. Missing pieces suck, and what‚Äôs the point of a research project if it‚Äôs just filled with loopholes you‚Äôre trying to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-time-doesnt-equal-greatness&#34;&gt;2. Time doesn‚Äôt equal greatness. &lt;a href=&#34;#2-time-doesnt-equal-greatness&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing: Great things take time, but taking your sweet time doesn‚Äôt guarantee the result will be groundbreaking. Sometimes, what you&amp;rsquo;re building isn&amp;rsquo;t even worth the time you&amp;rsquo;re pouring into it. Step back regularly and ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this a real problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will my solution actually solve it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being stuck in the process can make you blind to these questions. Pause. Reflect. Move on if needed. No one‚Äôs handing out trophies for effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-fear-feeds-procrastination-starve-it&#34;&gt;3. Fear feeds procrastination. Starve it. &lt;a href=&#34;#3-fear-feeds-procrastination-starve-it&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scared of something? Don‚Äôt delay. The problem won‚Äôt magically solve itself; it‚Äôll just fester. And by the time you confront it, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have made it worse in your head. Yes, figuring out what &lt;em&gt;doesn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; work takes time. But the right approach is always the shortest. Keep looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-dont-delegate-your-brainchild&#34;&gt;4. Don‚Äôt delegate your brainchild. &lt;a href=&#34;#4-dont-delegate-your-brainchild&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it‚Äôs your idea, own it. Completely. Don‚Äôt rely on others to fill in the gaps or do your chores, even if the gaps feel endless. Here‚Äôs why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It avoids you resenting others for expecting credit for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It saves others from resenting you for being credited less than you think they deserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teamwork is great; delegating your work is not. Seek collaboration, not help from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-academia-is-a-confidence-game-play-it&#34;&gt;5. Academia is a confidence game. Play it. &lt;a href=&#34;#5-academia-is-a-confidence-game-play-it&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe you‚Äôre the best. Yes, it feels arrogant. Yes, you‚Äôll feel like an imposter. Do it anyway. You won‚Äôt survive this field by doubting yourself.&lt;br&gt;
What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? You‚Äôre wrong? People laugh? Everyone gets it wrong sometimes (for you, probably most times). But if you don‚Äôt back yourself, no one else will. Ruthless environments demand ruthless confidence. Stay grounded, sure. Just don‚Äôt bury yourself in humility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Little Self Check</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-18/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 15:10:07 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to a big realization this past week: only I can truly help myself right now. It‚Äôs a lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve been late to fully grasp, but one that&amp;rsquo;s incredibly important. Reflecting on things like ethics and navigating the &amp;ldquo;grey areas&amp;rdquo; has always been part of my thoughts, but lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the power of expressiveness. The grey areas, though, make it tricky to show which side you lean toward, and representing yourself accurately is tough. Without clear self-representation, others will naturally judge‚Äîand honestly, they can‚Äôt see your context, so it&amp;rsquo;s logical from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I was taught that words are like arrows: once they‚Äôre out, they&amp;rsquo;re gone. But I‚Äôve realized words are more fluid than that‚Äîthough it‚Äôs easy to forget. Comedy, too, is subjective, and what‚Äôs funny to one person can fall flat or even offend another. Take a scenario where you trip and fall: it hurts, but you laugh. Misery has its own humor. Friends I‚Äôve had over the years kept laughing, kept joking, through good times and bad. In fact, joking about the hard stuff made it easier to deal with. But that approach doesn‚Äôt seem to resonate with everyone. The lesson? I have to think more about what I say now, because my words don‚Äôt always reflect my real intent. It‚Äôs affecting me professionally, too. My ideas don‚Äôt come through clearly, whether I‚Äôm writing or presenting. It‚Äôs not a language barrier; it‚Äôs a habit of treating words too casually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always known I was a bit of a hypocrite, but lately, my mindset has been less rigid and more fluid. I used to be strict with my principles, hard to budge, but now I feel myself blurring lines I&amp;rsquo;d normally hold firm. Maybe it‚Äôs the hectic schedule‚Äîany free time I get, I find myself swinging to extremes. I do have time, but I&amp;rsquo;m not using it well. Why do I only think about doing things when I‚Äôm actually busy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording time was one habit I had that helped. I need to start that again, but I should balance it with things that spark my interest. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it: no one can be endlessly productive. So maybe it‚Äôs time to set realistic goals instead of clinging to the fantasy of constant productivity. Yet, part of me wonders: will &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; goals make me feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t push myself hard enough? It‚Äôs strange, but even with ambitious goals, I&amp;rsquo;m not hitting them. Maybe the version of myself that chased discipline is what I need to restore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Something Cheerfully Gloomy</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-15/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 20:33:19 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Cover.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s late, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve messed up my time management last week. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything concrete to write about, but for the sake of consistency‚Äîand because it&amp;rsquo;ll help me remember this moment‚ÄîI&amp;rsquo;ve decided to pen down something abstract, even a bit gloomy. Despite the tone, the realization I had about it is important.
This week, after hearing the sad news of Shri Ratan Tata&amp;rsquo;s passing, I found myself reflecting on something abstract but deeply personal. I thought about his life, and suddenly, the most abstract and generic philosophy arose in my mind. It&amp;rsquo;s about what happiness really is. I know there are thousands of sources that define happiness differently, and some might even mock the question. But I&amp;rsquo;ve realized a definition that resonates with me uniquely and personally. I also know the tone of this text might seem like I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be just another wannabe philosopher, but here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness, I believe, is a fleeting period when the burdens of the past don&amp;rsquo;t weigh you down, and the future holds no looming expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s a moment in which you aren&amp;rsquo;t wishing for something better‚Äîwhether it&amp;rsquo;s as brief as the joy of savoring your favorite food, or as long as a stretch of time in the past that you wish had never ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, one of those longer stretches of happiness for me was during the COVID lockdowns. I was with my family, safe, and everyone‚Äîincluding my dad‚Äîwas working from home. Even though I was anxiously looking forward to future exams, I realize now that those were some of my happiest times. This contradiction is intentional because it leads to an important realization: Happiness isn&amp;rsquo;t static or absolute‚Äîit&amp;rsquo;s relative. A single event can carry both sadness and joy, depending on how you view it over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stretch of happiness came during the last two years, surrounded by friends, despite feeling burdened by uncertainty about my career and a tendency toward lethargy. Even though I was stuck in those feelings, I had the freedom to speak openly and enjoy the little moments with them‚Äîlike our simple treks up and down the bridge near the tapri. During that time, I understood how fleeting such experiences were, knowing they would end soon. And when they did end, and I returned home, it felt like just another summer. But, I realize now how much I cherish those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since coming to Singapore, I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled to recreate that environment. I tried replacing those feelings with finding hobbies or by meeting new people, but nothing felt quite the same. When neither worked, I found myself clinging to the past, realizing‚Äîonce again‚Äîthat you can&amp;rsquo;t live in those moments forever. I recalled the &amp;ldquo;canon events&amp;rdquo; those defining moments when it all started, from our first interactions to every shared memory, regardless of whether they were captured in photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflection led me to the most generic question: Can we ever be happy forever? And then the most textbook answer came to me‚Äî&amp;ldquo;Change is the only constant.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a truth that may seem sad, but it also makes sense. Without this constant change, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cherish the past or look forward to the future. While I can only connect the dots in hindsight, the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m reflecting on this now means I&amp;rsquo;m ready to embrace the next &amp;ldquo;canon events&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I still can&amp;rsquo;t figure out what we&amp;rsquo;re even doing in life. Running around trying to ‚Äúmake an impact,‚Äù while the people we actually want to keep around are‚Ä¶ well, not around. It&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;Congrats, you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked the &amp;rsquo;life goals&amp;rsquo; achievement! Too bad everyone you want to share it with is conveniently out of reach. Classic!&amp;rdquo; It makes you wonder‚Äîare we just collecting successes or secretly playing hide-and-seek with the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, sure, people say, ‚ÄúYou&amp;rsquo;ll find new people to share this with,‚Äù and that&amp;rsquo;s great and all. But why does the old one have to be replaced? Sounds depressing, right? Well, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;ve got plenty of free time, so I overthink all of this for you. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I am on vacation...</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-08/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 05:59:27 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-08/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the conclusion of the first half of 2023. As I reflect on these past months, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered some challenges. However, I believe that this year has not been in vain. Amidst it all, there are aspects for which I am truly grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bright spots has been my time in Canada. The beauty of this country surrounds me, and each day brings a sense of warmth and positivity. Additionally, I appreciate the work ethic prevalent here, which has propelled me forward. The progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made is commendable, and although my current domain may not align with my post-graduation plans, I consider myself fortunate to have exceptional supervisors who are not only training me in technical skills but also imparting knowledge about research methodology and problem-solving. This overall experience has boosted my confidence. However, there are still personal challenges I struggle to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who engage in discussions with me or seek my guidance often perceive me as possessing a distinct mindset with exceptional self-control. Regrettably, that perception is not entirely accurate. While I do exercise control over a significant portion of my mind, there remains a part that is untamed, comparable to an unleashed dog. My motivation to address these personal demons tends to be short-lived. If I could somehow overcome the barriers preventing me from relinquishing things I should have let go of long ago, I believe I could become a physically and mentally resilient individual. Yet, I must admit that I have been failing for a considerable time. I&amp;rsquo;m uncertain when I became so lacking in willpower. There was a period when willpower was among my most formidable traits, but now I find myself unable to rein in my dopamine-driven brain and my perpetually hungry stomach. Time is passing, and I am growing older, all while still unsure of what lies ahead in life. While my previous retrospections have demonstrated the benefits of accepting and making the best of my circumstances, there remains an underlying fear that lingers. My most recent mental accomplishment has been the realization of letting go of worries that are beyond my control, and instead focusing on maximizing what I have while refraining from complaints. This realization has served as my driving force. However, I sense that my motivation is waning, and it is crucial for me to make progress. Although I possess the intellect to identify my demons, I lack the courage to confront them. This inner conflict consumes me daily, even as I lay down to sleep, yearning for the prospect of a better tomorrow. Yet, I find myself in the same weakened state each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that perhaps I have been trying too hard to combat my weaknesses; it is time to approach this battle wisely. Rather than implementing drastic and short-lived lifestyle changes, I should focus on making small adjustments that can be sustained. It&amp;rsquo;s true that countless individuals have extolled the effectiveness of incremental changes, but I have always been reluctant to seek advice, even though I have undoubtedly missed out on valuable insights throughout my life. Somehow, I derive satisfaction from deciphering these moral codes on my own, despite their availability to us all. Therefore, I propose dividing my objectives into two distinct tasks: identifying what needs to be relinquished and determining which habits I need to adopt. Although this endeavor aims to restore discipline, I am well aware that it will require time. Instead of hiding behind the shadows of these retrospective blog posts and merely acknowledging my flaws without taking action, I must focus on personal growth before returning to this platform to share my progress at the end of the year. In essence, I am truly going on a journey of self-improvement for the latter half of 2023, akin to a vacation dedicated to my personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I asked chatgpt to make the language of my blog elegant and free from typos.

      <title>Second Month into retrospection</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-07/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February started with tests and midsems, I could not focus on my work because of the same although somehow I managed to go through the stressful midsem fortnite without much panic this time, although I could have studied a bit more for my electives. Other than this time I was involved in one of my project works and lost a track of time and couldn&amp;rsquo;t balance time and this time I was struck so deep into one of the projects that when I went home I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend time with my family too. Through this, I realized a positive and negative quality of my character. The positive reinforcement was not just self-realization but was through the appreciation of the project mentors. The positive quality was me being stuck to the problem until it is resolved, thus helping me realize my only strength, hard work. The negative being struck to the problem until it is resolved, being cocky and skipping my regular routine, going absolutely off my schedule. And as I speak of this, it can be easily inferred that I still have discipline issues as stated in the previous blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these days was Holi, it was one of the dullest and most depressing days on my campus as my friends whom I am usually with, were home. I made a resolution to have some routine in my life, I was able to simulate it for slightly over a week. But again when the project I was so involved with getting over on Friday. After all the mental exhaustion, I felt the need to have a day off. I planned to study some books related to my curriculum and others but I just skipped all of that and till this time I am binge-watching suits, completely gone off track, the schedule has been disrupted and I am still not able to bring it on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that when I am struck with some task I can give my full dedication to it, I don‚Äôt know why but I feel the need for closure and when the work is done, I lose the will to do anything else. I plan to come back on track and somehow I understand that I have to keep some time off everything so that I won‚Äôt get exhausted and when I take breaks, I don‚Äôt go rogue and regret it later. Well, this sums up the whole guilt trip, I have been having for the past 2 days, I am very ashamed but when I started this it was 2:00 pm and I started binge-watching again, and it‚Äôs 6:00 pm now. My biggest problem is I have no control even though I know my ills, when I cross that thin line rather than coming back, I go rogue and make it worse. I have always been able to realize this but never correct it. Now that I see it, I think it‚Äôs my biggest ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is also the day class X boards end and I just realized it has been 6 long years since it ended for me. I would have never thought to make it this far and certainly I feel old. It‚Äôs uptime for me to make amends to my living, I am just writing this as a log so that I never forget. There are many things to do I better start soon because soon I will be out of undergraduate too. Let‚Äôs see if I can come back after crossing boundaries or still go rogue next time I write these blogs&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First month into retrospection</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-06/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 19:47:55 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blog6-cover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year started with me going to Bhutan on the first day of the year. Probably the nicest time I will have in the whole year, although when I was on the trip I wanted to come back and resume my work and come to campus as the semester already started and I was missing the entire first week of classes. During this trip, I had a lot of time to think, relax and enjoy the trip as well. The weather was chilly but the rooms were cozy and after a whole day of exploring the places I used to love to come to my room and work. To be honest, I was not as excited as the other members on the trip, but now when I think about it, I am not going to have that level of peace and serenity for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I came back I was excited to dwell into my work, I had 2 projects ongoing, I enjoyed being busy and at the same time, I attended classes to keep up with acads. But soon I fell ill and I don‚Äôt know how but the sickness prevailed for the next 2 to 3 weeks. During my trip to Bhutan, I made some resolutions just to increase my willpower and also improve my health which as I mentioned earlier is kind of my only resolution, this year. So I avoided sugar, maida, and junk food, ate a meal once a day, and the remaining time sprouts or milk. But it was hard to keep my mental sanity and ridiculously decrease the calorie intake, since I was ill too I became weak and had to quit after 2 weeks, My other streak was of taking a bath daily which I did at &lt;strong&gt;-3 degree&lt;/strong&gt; Celsius in Bhutan too. I recently broke this streak on 9th February due to a hectic and messed up day which I may mention ahead. After recovering from illness, I was not able to bring my dietary habits on track and thus yet to this day I am yet to come back to my resolution. During all this, I was trying to do my work and was busy with one of the works and thus also began to skip my learning time. At the end of last month, I got an offer for a summer research project, which sounds great but was a nightmare for me. I have been working in various fields all of which fall into one big domain, this one was one of them but not exactly the one I want to pursue higher studies in, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure to choose between this research opportunity or my industry internship offer that I got through campus. Thus, upon considering the views of some of my seniors and friends and yes ChatGPT I made my choice. I questioned my choice for many days, seeing nightmares about the road not taken, for real used to have dreams about it. Well, I am a bit calmer now, since I talked to my professor and one of the seniors working in the industry. Well during this time fest was going on and I missed almost all of it and realized the value of having people around although on the non fest days I prefer to be in my solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went home, met my family, and tried to bring my messed-up routine on track, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Since we are retrospecting, I should be completely honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have started working on 2 projects, I am not able to give time to learning and the thought of losing time always bothers me, whether I am in my room or outside in a gathering. I have lost discipline and concentration. So, the harder I try to force it on me, the farther it‚Äôs going away from me. I think about changes I should make to my life; then as usual I think of starting on a fresh day and the remaining time is wasted and I am not able to start the next day too. The cycle keeps on repeating and thus to compensate for the time lost I cancel the time that I should give to my health or other self-development habits or to be very honest, meal time. I know my demons and thus I am always worried and anxious about fixing them. But I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way for rather than forcing discipline into my life, it should be a part of me. I have a lot to defend and a lot to fight for, I need a way to balance both of them. Rather than waiting for the clock to sync and then make changes in my life. I should function asynchronously and reset the clock at the present time because if I don‚Äôt, I am going to miss the posedge of the next clock cycle and never going to make changes to my life. I think I may have to read the book I have been cursing my friend for reading (Atomic Habits). Also, I think I should stop making targets to complete and just do what I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah thats it.

      <title>A Question, I can&#39;t Really answer right now.</title>
      <link>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-02/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 01:42:34 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://adi4blogs.netlify.app/posts/blog-entry-02/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-really-dont-know&#34;&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t know! &lt;a href=&#34;#i-really-dont-know&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;üîó&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yo! So this is it, finally I am starting to write this blog. I have been planning to write this blog since last weekend but mehhhh, I am lazy. So since last one week I have been bombed with a specific genre of questions by my well wishers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What next? What do I plan to do next? What profile have I shortlisted for the upcoming campus internship drive? Or do I plan to go for research?&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had asked me the same question 3-4 months back then I would have had a clear answer for these questions, But to be honest, I have no idea right now. Last few months have been rough on me, I have been rejected for several project opportunities, performed badly in acads, brutally rejected in a project interview and was made to realize that I am not even near my research interest. Well in short I succumbed to the competition. And the results of last semester made it worse. I really lost my confidence and still feel insecure about my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But time heals everything and it really has helped me to realize a lot of things I have been doing wrong, I have corrected some of them, some mistakes are beyond repair and some I still can&amp;rsquo;t stop doing. But still I try to avoid the question &lt;strong&gt;What next?&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the start of summers I have been trying to shortlist a set of profiles or broaden my area of interest. But every time I sit with a notepad jotting down a set of topics that I like, the list becomes toooo long and I can&amp;rsquo;t figure &lt;strong&gt;the one&lt;/strong&gt; out of them. But earlier this week I realized these things are a compilation of ¬†what I imagined myself to be when I am over 18 and all of those topics suddenly seemed to be a wishlist bucket. Well so the question still stands: &lt;strong&gt;What do I want to be?&lt;/strong&gt; because i don&amp;rsquo;t think I am master in any of them and it&amp;rsquo;s uptime for me to make a decision because now I am in pre-final year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did what I thought was right to do, I closed my eyes and slept for straight 3 hrs. Well the picture was not clear to me. So I closed my eyes again and slept&amp;hellip;. Jk I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep, I tried to imagine what I can work on for the next 10 years and not regret it. But tbh nothing close came to my mind, It&amp;rsquo;s just void. I can&amp;rsquo;t see my future in anything. At Least people have fantasies about the next 5 years of their life but I don&amp;rsquo;t see any of them right now. It&amp;rsquo;s Void!!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again the best thing I have learnt this summer is to calm down and let time fill the void. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too tense about what I will do next, because one thing that I know for sure is it may take time but I always get a part of what I want and yes I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. -&amp;gt; I wrote this blog so that I can calm down and always remember what I really think is a good lesson for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing off &lt;br&gt;

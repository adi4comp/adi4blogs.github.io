<p>It&rsquo;s late, and I feel like I&rsquo;ve messed up my time management last week. I didn&rsquo;t have anything concrete to write about, but for the sake of consistency—and because it&rsquo;ll help me remember this moment—I&rsquo;ve decided to pen down something abstract, even a bit gloomy. Despite the tone, the realization I had about it is important.
This week, after hearing the sad news of Shri Ratan Tata&rsquo;s passing, I found myself reflecting on something abstract but deeply personal. I thought about his life, and suddenly, the most abstract and generic philosophy arose in my mind. It&rsquo;s about what happiness really is. I know there are thousands of sources that define happiness differently, and some might even mock the question. But I&rsquo;ve realized a definition that resonates with me uniquely and personally. I also know the tone of this text might seem like I&rsquo;m trying to be just another wannabe philosopher, but here it goes.</p>
<p>Happiness, I believe, is a fleeting period when the burdens of the past don&rsquo;t weigh you down, and the future holds no looming expectations. It&rsquo;s a moment in which you aren&rsquo;t wishing for something better—whether it&rsquo;s as brief as the joy of savoring your favorite food, or as long as a stretch of time in the past that you wish had never ended.</p>
<p>Looking back, one of those longer stretches of happiness for me was during the COVID lockdowns. I was with my family, safe, and everyone—including my dad—was working from home. Even though I was anxiously looking forward to future exams, I realize now that those were some of my happiest times. This contradiction is intentional because it leads to an important realization: Happiness isn&rsquo;t static or absolute—it&rsquo;s relative. A single event can carry both sadness and joy, depending on how you view it over time.</p>
<p>Another stretch of happiness came during the last two years, surrounded by friends, despite feeling burdened by uncertainty about my career and a tendency toward lethargy. Even though I was stuck in those feelings, I had the freedom to speak openly and enjoy the little moments with them—like our simple treks up and down the bridge near the tapri. During that time, I understood how fleeting such experiences were, knowing they would end soon. And when they did end, and I returned home, it felt like just another summer. But, I realize now how much I cherish those moments.</p>
<p>Since coming to Singapore, I&rsquo;ve struggled to recreate that environment. I tried replacing those feelings with finding hobbies or by meeting new people, but nothing felt quite the same. When neither worked, I found myself clinging to the past, realizing—once again—that you can&rsquo;t live in those moments forever. I recalled the &ldquo;canon events&rdquo; those defining moments when it all started, from our first interactions to every shared memory, regardless of whether they were captured in photos.</p>
<p>This reflection led me to the most generic question: Can we ever be happy forever? And then the most textbook answer came to me—&ldquo;Change is the only constant.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a truth that may seem sad, but it also makes sense. Without this constant change, I wouldn&rsquo;t cherish the past or look forward to the future. While I can only connect the dots in hindsight, the fact that I&rsquo;m reflecting on this now means I&rsquo;m ready to embrace the next &ldquo;canon events&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although I still can&rsquo;t figure out what we&rsquo;re even doing in life. Running around trying to “make an impact,” while the people we actually want to keep around are… well, not around. It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Congrats, you&rsquo;ve unlocked the &rsquo;life goals&rsquo; achievement! Too bad everyone you want to share it with is conveniently out of reach. Classic!&rdquo; It makes you wonder—are we just collecting successes or secretly playing hide-and-seek with the universe?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, people say, “You&rsquo;ll find new people to share this with,” and that&rsquo;s great and all. But why does the old one have to be replaced? Sounds depressing, right? Well, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve got plenty of free time, so I overthink all of this for you. See you next week.</p>

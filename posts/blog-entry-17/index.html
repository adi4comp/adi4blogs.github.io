<p>I thought about writing a technical blog, but the illusion of having too much work this week stopped me from using my time wisely. Let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>
<p>We often feel overwhelmed by our workload. When we finish a task, we think we deserve a break. Yet, even if the workload isn&rsquo;t that heavy and we have plenty of time left, we still feel mentally exhausted. The brain works in funny ways!</p>
<p>When you have a lot on your plate, your mind races with everything you want to do when you have free time. But for me, any free time I have (the kind I&rsquo;m not tracking) passes by quickly. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting how the semantics of time work? Time flies when you&rsquo;re not thinking about it. But the moment you start to pay attention, it feels like it slows down. For example, I can hear my heartbeat when running, but my eyes are glued to the treadmill timer. I&rsquo;m just waiting for those 20 minutes to pass, and it feels like I&rsquo;ve run a marathon!</p>
<p>Now, considering time as a dimension, general relativity tells us that time dilation occurs when moving at high speeds or being in a strong gravitational field. This is indeed a correct application of the theory. But is that all there is to it? Are there other factors influencing time dilation?</p>
<p>In physics, there&rsquo;s a concept called entropy, which helps us understand how energy spreads out and becomes less useful over time. This idea can be thought of as the &ldquo;arrow of time&rdquo;—as things move from order to disorder. You could say time helps determine how energy is used or wasted, even if time itself isn&rsquo;t consumed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the philosophical idea of eternalism, which suggests that past, present, and future all exist at once. So, rather than time &ldquo;running out,&rdquo; every moment is just there, and our experience of moving through time is like traveling through a library of moments that are already written. When we feel like we&rsquo;re wasting time, it might just be our perception of moving through those moments.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, when we think about information, time can relate to how quickly we process and understand things. If we spend time on something unproductive, it might feel like we&rsquo;re wasting it—kind of like when our devices slow down, and it takes forever to get anything done.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, there’s this idea called decoherence, where the tiny building blocks of reality interact with their surroundings, making things more predictable over time. It’s a bit like how a lively party turns into a quieter gathering as people leave; the chaos settles into order.</p>
<p>As I explore these ideas, I wonder if any of this is true. It’s hard to grasp, right? If time exists as a dimension, what about the rate at which it changes? If all moments in time are out there, does that mean the energy at any moment never really moves on?</p>
<p>The uncertainty of it all makes me skeptical. Each theory presents a compelling story, but they also raise more questions than answers. If time is an illusion, what is the reality we’re experiencing? And if our perception is merely a reflection of those timelines, can we ever truly waste it? But if we stop worrying about how much time we have or don&rsquo;t have, we might find that there’s enough time for everything that truly matters.</p>
